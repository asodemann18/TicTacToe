# TicTacToe

## Project by: [Alex Sodemann](https://github.com/asodemann18)

## About:

The goal of this project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game that has a board in the middle and then players' stats on either side.  The top of the page shows whose turn it is, who won the game, and can say when there's a draw.  The left and right of the page show how many wins each player has and a mini visualization of the winning boards.

## Project Goals:

* Write DRY JavaScript
* Use localStorage to persist data
* Use event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use problem solving process to break down large problems

### Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git/GitHub

### Wins

* Thinking with a data model first mindset
* Understanding the work flow for using a data model, local storage, and the DOM together
* Using grid/flex together

### Challenges

* Writing DRY code, especially for the win logic
* Displaying the mini game boards on each players' side
* Control flow with localStorage
