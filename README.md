# [TicTacToe](https://asodemann18.github.io/TicTacToe/)

## Project by: [Alex Sodemann](https://github.com/asodemann18)

## About:
The goal of this project is to build a Tic Tac Toe game that has a board in the middle and then players' stats on either side.  The top of the page shows whose turn it is, who won the game, and can say when there's a draw.  The left and right of the page show how many wins each player has and a mini visualization of the winning boards.

## Project Goals:
* Write DRY JavaScript
* Use localStorage to persist data
* Use event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
